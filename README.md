### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

#### Prerequisites

You must have Git and Miniconda (or Anaconda) installed on your system.

* [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

#### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AhmedZhi10/e-commerce-django.git](https://github.com/AhmedZhi10/e-commerce-django.git)
    cd e-commerce-django
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate the Conda Environment:**
    This command uses the `environment.yml` file to create a new Conda environment with all the required packages.
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    After the environment is created, activate it:
    ```sh
    conda activate ecommerce_env 
    ```
    > **Note:** The environment name (`ecommerce_env`) is defined in the `environment.yml` file. Check the file if you need to confirm the name.

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    The project uses a `.env` file for sensitive settings. Rename the example file:
    ```sh
    # On Linux/macOS
    mv .env.example .env
    # On Windows
    rename .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values, especially the `SECRET_KEY`.

4.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    This will create the necessary tables in your database.
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a Superuser:**
    This account will give you access to the Django admin panel.
    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Run the Development Server:**
    You're all set! Start the server:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### ðŸ“š API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the auto-generated API documentation at the following endpoints:

* **Swagger UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/`
* **ReDoc:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/redoc/`
